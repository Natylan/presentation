        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>Good evening. I would like to introduce myself <br>
            I am Natalia. I come from the world of art, design and composition. I learned to paint marbled paper as a self-taught. I have worked as a bookbinder and paper decorator for bookbinders. Currently I live with my partner in Portugal. We are both immersed in the path of transfer to the digital world and programming.
            Gradually I have felt the call to enter the digital world and programming. And that's why I am here.
            </p>
        
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My highest goals: <br> are to create what does not yet exist in existing programs, but has already emerged as ideas in my head.
            for example: create the marble pan to digitally paint paper.
            <br>
            But following the chronology of the logical steps. As they say, you have to start at the beginning.
             <br>
            short-term goals: <br>
            become a web developer and work in that field
            
            </p>
        <h2>My latest achievements</h2>
        <p>Finding a very good teacher who has been guiding and supporting me for the last 7 months, with her I am learning logic and programming in python.
            <br>
            She showed me the challanges of CODEWARS, HACHERRANK, she introduced me to the world of github.
            <br>
        
            Since 2015 when I discovered the domestika platform, I started with calligraphy, aquarelle and 
            painting courses, 
            to gradually move on to the digital world, continuing with potoshop, illustrator, until my last 
            purchases were wordpress courses, online business.
            <br>
            I am currently doing a course to learn responsive web, but they are still very basic.  
            <br>
            I won three PRO months to study freely in CODECADEMY which I used to complement my 
            fundamentals in python, and a basic introduction to command lines.  
            <br>
            I am currently enrolled in a program with the people of Lewagon Lisbon, I have also won 
            participation in this workshop, divided into 8 sessions to learn how to make a landing page and 
            a program to learn how to create a user account.  
            <br>
            I have also signed up for a webinar with the people of ironhack for the creation of web pages, 
            but it is two sessions of two hours only.              
            
            </p>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>As you can see, my interest in this world is growing. <br>
            Sometimes it seems to me that one can easily get lost in so much information and that unnecessary time can be wasted learning something.
            That with a guide like the intensive 9-week ironhack program it would be solved without distractions.
            At this point of doing everything on my own, I think it would be a win for me to access your bootcamp and head over to. and for you, because I am a person who has a lot of interest, energy and time available to dedicate to it.
            
            </p>
        <h2>What is your greatest strength/weakness?</h2>
        <p>I would say that my greatest strength is my tenacity. When I decide to do something, I want to do it well, so I am willing to put in the time and effort to do it. Perhaps it is not just about doing it well, but about satisfying a hunger that comes from within me, if that hunger is appeased, it gives me satisfaction, and that is what I want to share with the world
            <br>
            I would say that my weakness is that sometimes I get obsessed with things, which makes me lose perspective, and without it the most insignificant obstacles could turn into problems. Luckily in the last time I am practicing meditation, which makes me get out of the temporary obsession to look at things from a new point of view
        <h2>Some questions for you</h2>
        <p>Which are the steps to follow?
            <br>
            What does Ironhack expect of me?
            <br>
            What do I need to get the full scholarship?
            <br>
            Do you have an accompaniment to the world of work in your program?
            <br>
            Can all the content be assimilated in the time of the bootcamp, or is extra time needed?
            <br>
            Can I see work that former students have done in past bootcamps?
